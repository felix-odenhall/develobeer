<h1> Develobeer </h1>

<h3>Hyper Island Project 1</h3>

<strong>Brief:</strong> An individual build that features HTML, CSS and Javascript, and is responsive.

<strong>Timeframe:</strong> Six weeks.

<strong>Description:</strong> Develobeer is a random beer shuffle generator, where the user could get inspiration for different beers. 
I was inspired by: https://vadfanskajaglagatillmiddag.nu/, which is a Swedish website where you are given a suggestion of what you could cook for dinner.
Initially I used Wordpress CSM as a database for the different beers, but I had some problems which made me use a JSON file instead.

<strong>Key learnings:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Responsive design</li>
<li>Sass</li>
  <li>Create custom JSON file and extract data from it</li>
  </ul>
